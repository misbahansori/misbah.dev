# Why You Should Not Use Global State Composable in Nuxt

Using global state composables in Nuxt 3 may seem convenient, but they come with hidden pitfalls, especially in SSR (server-side rendering). Here’s why you should avoid them and what to use instead.

## Key Issues with Global State Composables

### State Leakage in SSR

Global state composables store data outside of request scopes, causing **unintended data sharing** between users if modified on the server.

#### Example: Shared State Across Requests

```ts
// app/composables/useCounter.ts

const count = ref(0);

export const useCounter = () => {
  const increment = () => count.value++;

  return { count, increment };
};
```

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
const { count, increment } = useCounter();

// Modify state on the server
count.value++;
</script>

<template>
  <div>
    <div>Count: {{ count }}</div>
    <Button @click="increment">Increment</Button>
  </div>
</template>
```

> If modified on the server, `count` persists across users, leading to state leakage.

### Inconsistent Behavior Between Server and Client

Since global state is reused across requests, it behaves differently in SSR and client-side, causing hydration mismatches and unexpected resets.

---

### Debugging Challenges

State persistence across requests makes debugging unpredictable and difficult.

---

### Memory Leaks

Global state can accumulate over time, leading to increased memory usage.

#### Example: Memory Leak

```ts
// app/composables/useFeed.ts
const posts = ref([]);

export const useFeed = () => {
  const addPost = (post) => posts.value.push(post);

  return { posts, addPost };
};
```

If used globally, `posts` keeps growing across requests, consuming more memory.

## Better Alternatives

### Use `useState()` for Request-Scoped State

Ensures fresh state per request, preventing SSR issues.

```ts
// app/composables/useCounter.ts
export const useCounter = () => {
  const count = useState("count", () => 0);

  const increment = () => count.value++;

  return { count, increment };
};
```

### Use Pinia for Structured Global State

Pinia ensures proper SSR state handling and avoids memory leaks.

```ts
// app/stores/counter.ts
import { defineStore } from "pinia";

export const useCounterStore = defineStore("counter", () => {
  const count = ref(0);

  const increment = () => count.value++;

  return { count, increment };
});
```

## Conclusion

❌ Avoid global state composables due to:

- **State leakage** if modified on the server.
- **Inconsistent SSR behavior**.
- **Difficult debugging**.
- **Memory leaks**.

✅ Instead, use [**useState()**](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/composables/use-state) for scoped state or [**Pinia**](https://pinia.vuejs.org/) for structured state management. This ensures efficient, predictable state handling in Nuxt 3. 🚀
