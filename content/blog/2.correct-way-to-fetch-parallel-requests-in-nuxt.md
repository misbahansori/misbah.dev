# The Right Way to Fetch Parallel Requests in Nuxt

When building a Nuxt application, you'll often need to fetch data from multiple APIs at the same time. A common approach is to use `Promise.all()` to run these requests in parallel, aiming for better performance.

However, doing it the wrong way will lead to some issues. Let's dive into the examples below to see what issues it might cause.

## ðŸš« The Wrong Way: Raw `Promise.all`

```ts
const [latestAlbums, featuredAlbums, featuredArtists] = await Promise.all([
  $fetch("/api/albums/latest"),
  $fetch("/api/albums/featured"),
  $fetch("/api/artists/featured"),
]);
```

While this seems simple and efficient, it has a major issue in **server-side rendering (SSR)**. Nuxt will first fetch the data **on the server**, and then **again on the client** after hydrationâ€”leading to **unnecessary duplicate requests**.

### Using `useFetch` inside the `Promise.all`

You might want to say "We can just use `useFetch` then", but it's not a good solution either.

```ts
const [latestAlbums, featuredAlbums, featuredArtists] = await Promise.all([
  useFetch("/api/albums/latest"),
  useFetch("/api/albums/featured"),
  useFetch("/api/artists/featured"),
]);
```

At first glance, this looks better because `useFetch` should be only called on the server. However, if you try to do this, it will **still result in duplicate requests** in SSR.

## âœ… The Correct Way: `useAsyncData` with `Promise.all`

The solution is to wrap `Promise.all` inside `useAsyncData` and then create computed properties for each data we want to use.

```ts
const { data } = await useAsyncData(() =>
  Promise.all([
    $fetch("/api/albums/latest"),
    $fetch("/api/albums/featured"),
    $fetch("/api/artists/featured"),
  ]),
);

const latestAlbums = computed(() => data.value[0] ?? []);
const featuredAlbums = computed(() => data.value[1] ?? []);
const featuredArtists = computed(() => data.value[2] ?? []);
```

This is the best approach because we are using `useAsyncData` to fetch the data once on the server and then it will be present on the client side without any additional client-side requests.

## ðŸš€ Conclusion

If you're using Nuxt and need to fetch multiple APIs in parallel, avoid using raw `Promise.all` or `useFetch` directly. Instead, wrap `Promise.all` inside `useAsyncData` to get **optimized, SSR-friendly, and efficient data fetching**. This approach ensures your app runs smoothly while avoiding unnecessary network requests.
