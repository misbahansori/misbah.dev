# How to Fix Laravel Telescope 403 Forbidden on Production

::Toc
::

Laravel Telescope is an essential tool for debugging and monitoring your Laravel applications. However, when deploying your application to a production environment, you may encounter a 403 Forbidden error when trying to access Telescope. In this blog post, we'll explore the causes of this error and provide practical solutions for resolving it.

## Understanding the 403 Forbidden Error

The 403 Forbidden error indicates that the server understood the request, but it refuses to authorize it. This can occur when accessing protected resources or when the server is misconfigured. In the context of Laravel Telescope, it typically means that the application is preventing access to Telescope's debug and monitoring features.

## Troubleshooting Laravel Telescope on Production

When encountering the 403 Forbidden error with Laravel Telescope on production, there are several steps you can take to diagnose and resolve the issue:

1.  **Make sure you're logged in**

    When you are not logged in, you will get a 403 Forbidden error when trying to access the Telescope dashboard.
    You need to make sure that you are logged in before trying to access the Telescope dashboard.

2.  **You haven't configured the `Authorize` middleware correctly**

    When you deploy your application to a production environment, you need to define the Gate that authorizes access to the Telescope dashboard. By default, the `Authorize` middleware only allows access to users in the `telescope` gate. You need to make sure that the `telescope` gate is defined correctly in your application.

    ```php
    Gate::define('telescope', function ($user) {
        return in_array($user->email, [  // [!code highlight]
            '...',
        ]);
    });
    ```

    > Replace `...` with the email addresses of users who should have access to the Telescope dashboard.

    Or if you want to allow only admin to access the Telescope dashboard, you can define the `telescope` gate as follows:

    ```php
    Gate::define('telescope', function ($user) {
        return $user->isAdmin();
    });
    ```

    > Note that the closure passed to the `Gate::define` method only runs when there is an authenticated user. If you are not logged in, the closure will not even run, and you will get a 403 Forbidden error.

3.  **Using a different Guard for authentication**

    As per writing of this blog post, If you are using a different guard for authentication, you cannot access the Telescope dashboard and there is no way to change the guard for Telescope. You can only use the default `web` guard for authentication.

    If you are using a different guard for authentication, you need to create a new middleware and change the default telescope middleware.

    ```bash
     php artisan make:middleware AuthorizeTelescope
    ```

    Then, you need to change the default telescope middleware in the `config/telescope.php` file.

    ```php
    'middleware' => [
        'web',
        // remove the default middleware
        Authorize::class,
        // custom middleware to authorize telescope
        AuthorizeTelescope::class,
    ],
    ```

    In the `AuthorizeTelescope` middleware, you can define the logic to authorize access to the Telescope dashboard.

    ```php
    class AuthorizeTelescope
    {
        public function handle(Request $request, Closure $next): Response
        {
            if (app()->environment('local')) {
                return $next($request);
            }
            if ($request->user('admin')) {
                return $next($request);
            }

            abort(403);
        }
    }
    ```

    > In this example, we are checking if the user is an admin. If the user is an admin, we allow access to the Telescope dashboard. Otherwise, we return a 403 Forbidden error.

There you have it! By following these troubleshooting steps, you should be able to diagnose and resolve the 403 Forbidden error in Laravel Telescope on production.
